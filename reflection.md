Here in this lab, I was assigned to create a program that would read a document that contained headlines from a new company in different years.
In doing so, the program was also tasked with running some preset diagnostics and some determined by the user.
Essentially, the goal was to master working with file reading and defining functions.
After I figured out the way things were supposed to be mapped out, I first worked on writing out the main function, which contained most of the variable creation.
Once this was finished, I worked on the meat and potatoes of the program, reading and running diagnostics on the selected file in the main function.
I ended up getting a program that came out to be pretty close to what I expected it to be.
One particular issue I encountered in this project involved misplacing counters. I ended up putting one of the counters within a continuous loop, so it would reset each time it ran through.
This counter was the total word counter, and so I ended up with extraordinarily small numbers for my average word counts. Of course, I was able to solve this easily by placing it in its proper place.
The key takeaway? Double-check your code, always, and be sure you have a way of debugging your program at all times. Know what the best methods are.
In the end, I thought I did an OK job with this assignment, and I think I had good practice with working with reading files and lists.
